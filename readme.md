            reporter.startStep("Check it's fancy");
            // expect that it's fancy
            reporter.endStep();
            
            reporter.startStep("Check it's cool");
            // expect that it's cool
            reporter.endStep();

            reporter.addAttachment("Screenshot", screenshotBuffer, "image/png");

#### Warning
``jest-allure`` reporter dynamically configure "setupTestFrameworkScriptFile" option in Jest configuration.
**If you have your own setupTestFrameworkScriptFile file**, you need to manually register allure reporter, for it you need to import jest-allure/dist/setup.

```typescript
import "jest-allure/dist/setup";
```
